Look back on a time when you were enjoying something beyond anything else. Then you came to the realization that on certain newly discovered levels of yourself, that something does not bring satisfaction. Or even worse, it brings dissatisfaction, guilt, and a certain amount of rejection from others. That was a time when you were ignorant. And the ignorance allowed you to delve into that particular activity with full abandon. Once awareness starts to build up however, that abandon is no longer possible and it might even turn 180 degrees to become rejection.
