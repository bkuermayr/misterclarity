Sure, we all want stuff, but the question is...do we really want it, or is it coming from societal "values" or parental desires?

We live in a society similar to the supermarket:

1. it offers way too much choice 
2. some of the choices are framed as "superior" to others
3. Many of the choices are so devoid of real value that they leave you in a worse state than you were in before you "bought" it
