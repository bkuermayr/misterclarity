I was talking to a friend today about the pressure between living in a  relaxed manner (doing seemingly non-productive activities like going for walks and meeting with friends) and pursuing the many things in life that she wants to achieve. This is what crossed my mind...

Sure, we all want stuff, but my question is...do we really want it, or is it coming from societal "values" or parental desires? Sometimes I feel like we live in a society that's similar to a supermarket:

1. it offers way too much choice ("Blueberries in the winter? No problem!" | "Single mom and employee of the month? Why not?")
2. some of the choices are framed as "superior" to others ("Fame and fortune always trump working with your hands in the dirt.")
3. many of the choices are so devoid of real value that they leave you in a worse state than you were in before you "bought" them. (Get married young, have kids while you're healthy. | Place many your unfulfilled needs upon their shouders.")

We often walk through the societal supermarket due to its convenience. It's the biggest, most comfortable, and closest to shop at. Will the food be of high quality and good for you? You might be allergic to gluten (9 - 17 job). Could we find something that's better for us if we go to the local farmer (away from our comfort zone)? Get the same nutrients from half the amount of  food (spiritual practice versus societal wins. Should we give up convenience for the benefit of a more meaningful personal happiness? Always.
