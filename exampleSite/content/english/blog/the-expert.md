A coaching session is said to have no expert. This is meant for the coach, partially to remind them that the client is creative, resourceful, and whole. Yet during my practice I have noticed there an expert present. Namely, you. Often in life we listen to advice from seemingly wise sources, from people, from books, from friends and family, from scientists. Yet we forget that in terms of our own lives, there is only one true expert. Our Self. There is an inner guide that remains steadfast no matter what happens externally. This presence is to be found in various ways, but rarely does engaging with society bring its voice to the foreground.
