Recognizing that we are part of something bigger than ourselves and that our actions account for mostly 80% of the outcome, with 20% coming from without, allows us to take our fears less seriously and avoid risking to do harm when we actually mean well. For example, worrying so much that we only communicate the bad things our child does. Thinking that if we do not address it, it will bcome a big problem, that the kid will become a failure, etc. And so we end up looking for problems to address, and forget to praise, support, and love. We forget to communicate the positive. And the kid ends up feeling that he/she is never good enough, and struggling to find the confidence necessary to take risks, or relate deeply, for fear that the situation will return, and only a part of them will be addressed by the ensuing relationship. 

PS Basically, spirituality means living with and honoring the awareness that things are to a large degree the way they should be, and that even the worst tragedy has positive effects which we cannot forsee, and the most positive of good luck carries negatives which we do not suspect. And with this awareness, humanity as a species is no longer as desperate to survive. Whether we live or die eventually means life is taking its course.
