Imagine a presence so pure that merely coming close to it brings you to tears of awe.  A being that needs connection and nurturing, who offers support during tough times and fulfillment in the long run. Very vulnerable, but not helpless. Failing to connect with it results in losing its gifts, a lack of motivation, of follow-through, and of direction. A being so powerful that its manifestation during a crysis can seem like magic. It does not belong to you, yet it is uniquely connected to you for life. It is a delicate bond that you share and the connection it needs from you is a small price to pay for the wealth it provides. Does this sound familiar? Have you already met your soul?
