Chaos and order. Our lives are to some degree flowing on the spectrum between the two opposites. Both extremes lead to a miserable life.

> _"The Daoists believe that a meaningful life, the optimally meaningful life, is to be found on the border between chaos and order, and I would say that your nervous system tells you exactly when you are there, and itâ€™s a kind of place. You can tell when you are there because you are secure enough to be confident, but not so secure that you are bored, and you are interested enough to be awake, but not so interested that you are terrified. When you are in a state like that, when you find things interesting and meaningful, then time slips by you and you are no longer self-conscious." Jordan Peterson_
