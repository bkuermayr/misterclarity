Imagine a thunderstorm. Lighting bolts lighting up the sky, thunder booming in your ear bringing back perspective, rain falling from the sky, washing away debris. Then, once it is all over, a smell of fresh air seems to emanate from the ground and surround you. Every breath seems to bring extra energy, and animals previously hidden come out of their hiding. Congratulations, you've just experienced an "argument". A thunderstorm is nature's way of balancing out pent up energy that's become too stagnant.
