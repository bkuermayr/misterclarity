Imagine being in a thunderstorm. Lighting bolts, dark clouds, and thunder. The forces at play bring back perspective, the rain falling from the sky washes away the debris. Then, once it is all over, a smell of fresh air seems to emanate from the ground and surround you. Every breath seems to bring extra energy, and animals previously hidden come out of their hiding. Congratulations, you've just experienced an "argument". A thunderstorm is nature's way of balancing out pent up energy that's become too stagnant. Similarly, in our relationships we need an argument from time to time to wash away the debris that gathers up between two people in a relationship. So go ahead, fight things out with a partner while keeping in mind the clarity that follows. It helps to let go of the negative emotions that come up during the argument in order to get the most out of your "thunderstorms". Happy rainy day!
