What comes to mind when you see or hear the word **presence**? Is it related to the mind? Perhaps listening carefully? Feeling relaxed, open to ideas, aware...these are all qualities related to presence. Notice that I haven't mentioned anything about context. Usually presence refers to being with at least one other person around. Thus, we are usually present **with other people**. But presence can begin with one's self. Being present while no one is around. Being present. Or just being. What does that involve? Listening? Feeling relaxed, open to (own) ideas, being aware (of the body, of emotions, of needs, etc.)? In my case, most elements required in interpersonal presence apply to solo presence. 

So what about coaching? Why is presence a major ingredient in assuring a high quality coaching session? Well, simply put, presence (of others) is a basic human need. Yes, on the same level as sleep, food, and air. Why is that?  We might have solo presence, yet we crave to experience presence with another human being. As far as I can tell, because it satisfies a deep psychological need of **being seen**. Truly seen. This means being listened to intently as we express ideas. Having a shared space where both (or multiple) people step in with respect and manifest the fruits of their **evolution or struggle**. One derives **self-worth** from stepping inside this space and presenting what he or she chooses. The choice is important. And so is the audience. 

Society is meant, partially, to offer such a space. One where we get together and celebrate, grieve, or solve problems **together**. But in today's western society, real, deep, genuine presence is harder and harder to find. Celebrations are quickly forgotten in favor of the next achievement, grieving is for the weak (and it was your own fault in the first place), and problems are almost exclusively material or external (financial, technological, political, etc.)

Coaching offers a space for intimate, personal celebrations, a neutral, respectful space for grieving, and a rigorous space for problem-solving. This space enables the most hidden habits, values, ideas, feelings to come to the surface during the shared journey undertaken with the coach. It is the coach's **presence** that **encourages** one to go past the point of fear and self-doubt. To explore with **curiosity** past feelings of anxiety and into the areas where all the hidden resources, discarded dreams, and lost, or hidden identities reside. **Presence creates a bond** based on trust, calm awareness, and curiosity. People work for years to build such relationships. During coaching, due to the training and nature of coaches, this can be achieved in a few hours, if not minutes. You owe it to yourself to experience such a bond, for it serves a basic need whose absence becomes unbearable when the going gets tough.
