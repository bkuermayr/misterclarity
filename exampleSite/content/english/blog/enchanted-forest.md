Coaching feels like walking with a lantern through an enchanted forest. Every trinket, every leaf of grass, every breath of air is magical. Everything is loaded with a value and meaning which demand an attitude of awe and wonder. My lantern is there to help you find you way through that forest, with your heart in awe and your mind wonder-ing.
