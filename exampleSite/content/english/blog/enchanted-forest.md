Coaching feels like walking with a lantern through an enchanted forest. Every trinket I find, every leaf of grass, every breath of air is magical. Everything is loaded with a value and meaning which demand an attitude of awe and wonder. 

> The universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper. - paraphrase after a quote by Eden Phillpotts
