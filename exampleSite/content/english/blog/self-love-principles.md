**Healthy Food**

1\. Food has a purpose. Beyond that purpose its value quickly diminishes to the point of becoming toxic, addictive, or burdensome.

2\. Water can also be part of a meal. If desired, taking sips of room temperature water with a meal can aid digestion. An entire glass might do the opposite.

3\. Meals should be balanced from a nutritional point of view. Vegetables and fresh ingredients should always be the top priority.

4\. Food has added value when self-prepared. The ritual before a meal can be as important as the meal itself.

5\. Food is best enjoyed in peace. Ideally, no electronics should be in use, nor kept on the table. Soothing music in the background can be a good choice.

6\. Whenever possible, meals should be eaten warm. Not hot, and not cold from the fridge. Room temperature is acceptable, though not ideal.

7\. Meals should be enjoyed in an upright seated posture. Eating while lying in bed, lounging, or standing is best avoided.

8\. Stress impairs digestion. Anchor the beginning of a meal by breathing in and out deeply through the nose. Expressing one’s gratefulness for the food as well as for the body’s effort in the upcoming digestion calms the mind and prepares the body for receiving the food.

9\. Keeping a food diary containing the meal time, the amount and type of food can be useful and fun. One’s well-being can be traced to the food we eat.

10\. Fruit sugar is the best choice, but if fruits are not available, self-baked deserts are the best alternative.

11\. Having delicious and balanced meals is a form of self-love.
