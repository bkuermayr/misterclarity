    date: '"Vlad is a great listener..."'
    content: Vlad is a great listener and asks very insightful questions which prompt
      you to see the problem / situation in a different light. He helped me to get
      a new perspective on things which I could not unpick for years. And this empowered
      me to make choices instead of feeling stuck. I would recommend you to work with
      Vlad if you feel stuck in certain areas of your life and you are looking to
      gain crystal clarity on the next steps.

    date: '"Vlad is a very intuitive coach."'
    content: I gained a much deeper level of understanding as he skilfully managed
      to take me to look at certain areas I was avoiding due to past pain. It was
      an emotional journey of self-discovery to walk past the stories in my head and
      see the truth. I had an amazing aha! moment in which I knew with clarity what
      was the next step for me to take to improve my situation. I warmly recommend
      Vlad to anybody who is ready to challenge their beliefs/fears and see the truth
      to change his/her life.
